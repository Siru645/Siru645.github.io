title: "DMV Information Provision and Organ Transplantation"
abstract: "<span style='font-size:0.85rem; line-height:1.6; display:block;'> <em>Abstract</em>: This paper estimates the effect of DMV information provision on organ transplantation from deceased donors. Exploiting the staggered adoption of information provision policies across states from the 1980s through 2010s, I find that providing written educational materials during driver's license applicants and renewals increases transplants by 14-35% per zip code-year. Treatment effects grow over time: modest impacts in the first two years (11% increase) strengthen to 29-35% increases by years 11-15, consistent with cumulative exposure through repeated license renewals. I find no evidence of cross-state spillover effects. These findings demonstrate that DMV information provision can increase organ transplantation rate for in-state patients. </span>"
