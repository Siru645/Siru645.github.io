abstract: "<span style='font-size:0.85rem; line-height:1.6; display:block;'> <em>Abstract</em>: Standard matching theory assumes students have complete strict preferences, yet empirical evidence documents substantial rates of incomplete preferences in various choice contexts including school choice mechanisms. This paper provides the first experiment on extensions of Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanisms with incomplete preferences. Three key findings emerge. First, DA elicits higher overall consistent reporting rates than TTC driven by subjects with complete preferences, while subjects with incomplete preferences maintain high consistency under both mechanisms. Second, individual consistent reporting has a strong influence on determining welfare outcomes though the mechanisms are not strategyproof, generating more efficient and fair assignments. Third, students with incomplete preferences could benefit their peers: complete-preference students achieve higher exchange-proof assignment rates in mixed groups than in groups composed entirely of complete-preference students. These findings suggest that accommodating incomplete preferences in matching mechanisms can enhance welfare outcomes for all participants.</span>"
