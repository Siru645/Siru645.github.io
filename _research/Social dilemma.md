abstract: "<span style='font-size:0.85rem; line-height:1.6; display:block;'> <em>Abstract</em>: This study investigates how the origin of shared resources in social dilemma games influences individual behavior. By distinguishing between endogenous resources, created through deliberate collective action, and exogenous resources, existing independently of participants' choices, we explore how these origins impact decision-making. We construct a novel two-stage social dilemma game to determine whether the origination of a shared resource impacts the choice to further contribute or exploit. The game combines a traditional public goods provision game with a subsequent mixed game played over the newly established public account balance. We also construct a between-subjects triadic design to determine whether decisions are consistent with trust, reciprocity, or unconditional other-regarding preferences. Our results support the conclusion that resource origins matter, as subjects behave less cooperatively when group account balances are endogenously low. We also find that 50% of subjects have conditional other-regarding preferences when group account balances are exogenous. </span>"
